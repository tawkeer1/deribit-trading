# Deribit API Trading System in C++

This project is a trading system built in C++ for interacting with the Deribit Test API. It allows you to place, cancel, modify orders, view the order book, Get realtime data from deribit using websocketpp and retrieve current position details on the Deribit platform(https://test.deribit.com/). The project uses `cURL` for HTTP requests and `nlohmann/json` for JSON parsing.

## Features

- **Order Placement**: Submit orders at specific price and quantity for various instruments.
- **Order Management**: Cancel and modify existing orders.
- **Order Book Retrieval**: View detailed order book data including bids, asks, and market information.
- **Position Details**: Retrieve position details for a specific instrument.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: GCC (recommended) or any modern C++ compiler with C++11 support.
- **cURL**: Library for HTTP requests.
- **JSON for Modern C++**: Header-only library for JSON parsing by `nlohmann/json`.

## Dependencies

1. **cURL**: Install via the following commands:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
    ```

2. **JSON for Modern C++**: Download the header file from [nlohmann/json GitHub page](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) or install via a package manager:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev
    ```
2. **Websocket**: Download the websocket from github:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev
## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Ensure the necessary libraries (`curl` and `nlohmann/json`) are installed.

3. Add the path to `json.hpp` if it's not already in your include path:
    - Place `json.hpp` in the `include/` directory within the project.

## Compilation

Use the following command to compile the project:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main -std=c++17 -I. -lpthread -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto
